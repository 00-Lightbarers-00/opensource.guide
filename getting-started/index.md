First things first: we're here to help you launch projects of all shapes and sizes, but you may find certain sections more or less useful, depending on what you need.

* TOC

## You're open sourcing a project for the first time

You've heard a lot about this "open source" thing and you'd like to release a project for the first time.

If you're worried about getting things right, check out ["Preparing for launch"](preparing) for a quickstart guide, as well as the [Marketing](../marketing) section.

## You've open sourced projects before, but you'd like to sharpen your skills

You currently maintain a few open source projects. You understand the basic mechanics, but there are some things you think you could do better.

If you're hoping to improve your skills as a maintainer, take a look at the [Sustaining Growth](../sustaining) and [Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting) sections.

## You're trying to build a large community project

For you, the best part about open source is _collaboration_. You're excited to work on a project with people from all over the world.

If community is important to you, keep an eye out for resources such as ["Building a community"](../marketing/building-community) and ["Sustaining healthy communities"](../sustaining/healthy-communities).

## You're a company open sourcing a project

Your company is about to open source a previously internal project. You want to do it without breaking any laws or upsetting anyone who will interact with your project.

If you're hoping to become a good corporate citizen, ["The legal side of open source"](legal) and ["Leadership & governance"](../sustaining/leadership) can help you with trademark, license, and other company matters.

One more thing: we can give you advice on running an open source project, but we're not lawyers. Be sure to read our [disclaimer](../disclaimer) before you dive in.
