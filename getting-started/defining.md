So you're interested in making your project open source? Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ The world appreciates your contribution.

Let's start by talking about what it means to open source your work.

## Open source is more than just a license

When you "open source" a project, it means you've added [a certain set](https://opensource.org/osd) of legal protections and freedoms that allow others to interact with your project.

Open source licenses grant permission to everyone to use, modify, and share licensed software for any purpose, subject to certain conditions, depending on the license.

That's the legal side of it. In terms of culture, open sourcing a project has come to mean much more. There are many reasons why a person or organization might want to open source a project. For example:

* **Transparency:** Anyone can inspect an open source project for errors or inconsistencies. Transparency matters to governments like [Bulgaria](https://medium.com/@bozhobg/bulgaria-got-a-law-requiring-open-source-98bf626cf70a) or the [United States](https://sourcecode.cio.gov/), regulated industries like banking or healthcare, and security software like [Let's Encrypt](https://github.com/letsencrypt).

* **Collaboration:** Open source projects can accept changes and updates from anybody, which means they benefit from multiple skill sets and experiences. Collaboration matters to those who want to build their projects with a community, like [Hoodie](https://github.com/hoodiehq) and [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust).

* **Adoption and remixing:** Open source projects can be used by anyone for any purpose. They can be shared and reused (like [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)) to reach more people, or they can be used to build something else (like [WordPress and b2](https://github.com/WordPress/book/blob/master/Content/Part%201/2-b2-cafelog.md)).

Remember: open source isn't just for software! You can open source everything from data sets to websites to books. Check out [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore) for ideas on what else you can open source.

## Public projects on GitHub without a license are not open source

When you [create a new project](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/) on GitHub, you have the option to make the repository **private** or **public**.

Public repositories on GitHub are covered by [GitHub's Terms of Service](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#f-copyright-and-content-ownership), which gives other people the right to view and fork your repository. But if you want others to use, copy, modify, or contribute back to your project, you need to include an open source license.

A **public** repository is not **open source** unless you choose an open source license. For example, someone cannot legally use any part of your GitHub project in their code, even if it's public, unless you explicitly give them the right to do so. (You can learn more about the legal side of open source [here](../legal/).)

It's easy to add a license. You'll be [asked to add one](https://help.github.com/articles/open-source-licensing/) when you create a new repository.

When you open source a project, you open yourself to feedback and suggestions from other people who are engaged with your work. It might feel intimidating to open source a project for the first time, but remember that you're not alone.

In the next section, we'll help you figure out your goals around open sourcing your project. Understanding your goals beforehand will make it easier to manage your and others' expectations later on.
