title: Feeling guilty or burned out
---

Open source work once brought you joy. Maybe now it's starting to make you feel avoidant or guilty. Perhaps you're feeling overwhelmed or a growing sense of dread when you think about your projects. And meanwhile, the issues and pull requests pile up.

Burnout is a real and pervasive issue in open source work, especially among maintainers. Let's talk about how to make things better.

## Clearly communicate your limits

Most people who come across your project don't know anything about you or your circumstances. They may even think that you get paid to work on the project, especially if it's something they regularly use and depend on.

Maybe at one point you put a lot of time into your project but now circumstances have changed. You're juggling a new family and a full-time job, and you just don't have that much time to spend on open source work anymore. That's perfectly okay! Make sure other people know about it. Other people won't know what's happening in your life unless you tell them.

Write your time constraints directly into your README. If your time is purely volunteered, make sure that people are aware of your circumstances. You can even tell them exactly how many hours you spend on the project per week, or let them know which days you're most active. If your project is completely unmaintained or a low priority in your life, tell people that, too. You can read more about best practices for maintainers [here](../../sustaining/best-practices/).

## Write an agreement for maintainers and contributors

If you haven't noticed by now, the more you write down, the easier your life will be. ðŸ˜Ž  One thing you may want to consider writing down are ground rules and expectations for maintainers (and contributors!). Think of it as an extension of your code of conduct.

For example, as a maintainer, you might promise to acknowledge every contribution, even if you don't accept them. You might ask contributors to promise that their code passes all tests before they submit it.

[Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/5011/files), [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/wiki/Communication-&-Design-Rules), and [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Maintainers-Avoiding-Burnout.md) are several examples of projects that have ground rules for maintainers and contributors.

## Don't forget to take breaks

Although it should go without saying, take a vacation! Sometimes it can be hard to take a break from open source work when it feels like everybody is depending on you. People may even try to make you feel guilty for stepping away.

Do your best to find support for your users and community while you're away from a project. If you can't find the support you need, take a break anyway. Be sure to communicate when you're not available, so people aren't confused by your lack of responsiveness.

Taking breaks applies to more than just vacations, too. If you don't want to do open source work on weekends, or during work hours, communicate those expectations to others, so they know not to bother you.

## If you can't manage your project, let someone else take over

There's no shame in admitting when you don't have the bandwidth to care for your project anymore. If other people are enthusiastic about its direction, however, give them commit access or formally hand over control to someone else. If someone forked your project and is actively maintaining it elsewhere, consider linking to the fork from your original project. Take it as a compliment that so many people want to see your project live on!
