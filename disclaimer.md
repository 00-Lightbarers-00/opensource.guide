Running an open source project, like any human endeavor, involves uncertainty and trade-offs. We hope this handbook helps, but it may include mistakes, and can't address every situation. If you have any questions about your project, we encourage you to do your own research, seek out experts, and discuss with your community. If you have any legal questions, you should consult with your own legal counsel before moving forward.
