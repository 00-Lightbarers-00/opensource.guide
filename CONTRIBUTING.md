## Running the site locally

This site is powered by [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com). Running it on your local machine requires a working [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) installation with [Bundler](http://bundler.io/).

Once you have that set up, run:

    script/bootstrap
    script/server

â€¦and open http://localhost:4000 in our web browser.
