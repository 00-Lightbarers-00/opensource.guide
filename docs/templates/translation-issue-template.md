Repository: https://github/[yourname]/open-source-guide
Locale: `xx-YY`

On the `gh-pages` branch of your fork:

- [ ] Update `title`, `description`, and `locale` in `_config.yml`
- [ ] Copy `_data/local/en-US.yml` to a new file with the name of your locale and translate the strings.
- [ ] ??? TODO - other steps here

Once a translation is completed:

- [ ] Update `CNAME` in fork (e.g. de.opensource.guide)
- [ ] Open a Pull Request on the [upstream repository](https://github.com/github/open-source-guide) to add your fork to `translations` in `_config.yml`
