# Style Guide

From the [GitHub Manual of Style](https://manual-of-style.githubapp.com/)[^1], which this style guide inherits from:

> Words are an important part of how software works. Just as we have a style guide for our code, we have a style guide for our tone and our voice. Even though there may be dozens of people creating a product, it should still sound like we speak in one consistent voice.
>
> In other words, the way we write is just as important as the way we design. Consider these things when writing copy.

Where possible, [automated tests](../test/test-prose) enforce style rules.

## Mentions

When referring to people that use GitHub, use @mentions of their username instead of their full name.
