# Roadmap

Our vision for the Open Source Handbook is to offer resources to help individuals, communities, and companies sustainably embrace open source.

We launched the first version of the Handbook with the goal of helping people produce their own open source project. Eventually, we'd like to expand the Handbook to help people contribute to and consume open source, as well.

We'll spend the remainder of 2016 on the following priorities:

* Improving content for open source producers
* Fostering healthy community dynamics and making sure our feedback loops work as intended
* Improving discoverability of the Handbook for GitHub users

In 2017, we'll explore adding content for open source contributors and consumers. We also plan to move the Handbook to a permanent home on github.com/open-source.
