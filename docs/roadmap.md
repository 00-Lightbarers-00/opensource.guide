# Roadmap

Our vision for the Open Source Handbook is to offer resources to help individuals, communities, and companies sustainably embrace open source.

### 2016: Creators

* [x] Create a handbook that helps creators start and grow their own open source project
* [x] Make the handbook public and release it as an open source project
* [ ] Continue to improve the content for open source producers
* [ ] Foster healthy community dynamics so the handbook becomes a place to codify community best practices
* [ ] Improve the discoverability of the Handbook for open source creators

### 2017: Contributors & Consumers

* [ ] Move the [Contributing to Open Source on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/) guide to the handbook, and expand it to include community best practices for contributors.
* [ ] Expand the handbook to include content for open source consumers.

### Beyond

Open source is complicated, especially for newcomers. But the community has learned many lessons about the best way to use, contribute to, and produce open source software. Everyone shouldn't have to learn those lessons the hard way. To give it more prominence, we want to move it from http://opensource.guide to a permanent home on https://github.com/open-source, where it will live along side features and programs that help individuals, communities, and companies sustainably embrace open source. The content will remain open source for anyone to use.

This is our current plan. As with everything in this handbook, it is open to community feedback.
