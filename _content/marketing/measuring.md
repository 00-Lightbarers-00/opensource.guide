# **Measuring Success**

Your project is starting to grow.üå± Well, you think it‚Äôs growing. Is it growing? In this section, we‚Äôll talk about how to measure and track the success of your open source project.

## Discoverability

Before anybody can use or contribute back to your project, they first need to know it exists. The first question you‚Äôll want to ask yourself, then, is: *are people finding my project?*

If your project is hosted on GitHub, you can view how many people land on your project and where they come from. From your project‚Äôs page, click "Graphs", then ‚ÄúTraffic‚Äù. On this page, you can see:

* Total pageviews

* Total unique visitors

* Referring sites (where they came from)

* Popular content (where they go on your project, broken down by views and unique visitors)

[GitHub stars](https://github.com/blog/1204-notifications-stars) can also help provide a baseline measure of popularity. While GitHub stars don‚Äôt necessarily correlate to downloads and usage, they can tell you how many people are taking notice of your work.

You may also want to track discoverability in specific places: for example, Google PageRank, referral traffic from your project‚Äôs website, or referrals from other open source projects or websites.

## Usage

People are finding your project on this wild and crazy thing we call the Internet. Ideally, when they see your project, they‚Äôll feel compelled to do something. The second question you‚Äôll want to ask is: *are people using my project?*

If you use a package manager, such as npm or RubyGems.org, to distribute your project, you may be able to track your project‚Äôs downloads. Each package manager may use a slightly different definition of "download", and downloads do not not necessarily correlate to installs or use, but it provides some baseline for comparison.

If your project is on GitHub, navigate again to the "Traffic" page. You can use the [clone graph](https://github.com/blog/1873-clone-graphs) to see how many times your project has been cloned on a given day, broken down by total clones and unique cloners.

If usage is low compared to the number of people discovering your project, there are be two issues to consider: 1) that your project isn‚Äôt successfully converting your audience, or 2) that you‚Äôre attracting the wrong audience. For example, if your project lands on the front page of Hacker News, you‚Äôll probably see a traffic spike, but a lower conversion rate, because you‚Äôre attracting everyone on Hacker News instead of just your target audience. Try to figure out where your audience is coming from, and ask others for feedback on your project page, to figure out which of these two issues you‚Äôre facing.

## Retention

People are finding your project and they‚Äôre using it. The last area you‚Äôll want to think about: *are people contributing back to my project?*

This is a big one. Without other people pitching in, you risk putting yourself into an unhealthy situation where your project is popular (many people use it) but not supported (not enough maintainer time to meet demand). It‚Äôs never too early to start thinking about contributors!

Here are a few types of contributor metrics you may want to regularly keep track of:

* Total number of contributors, and number of commits per contributor (you can view this under "Graphs" -> ‚ÄúContributors‚Äù)

* Casual contributors (defined as contributors with only 1 commit, less than 5 commits, or whatever feels right to you)

* New vs. repeat contributors

* First time committers

* Open issues

* Open pull requests

* Types of contributions (ex. fixing typos, fixing bugs, commenting on an issue, commits)
