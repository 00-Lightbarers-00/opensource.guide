# **Marketing your project**

This section of the handbook will help you spread the word about your project and grow your initial community of users and contributors. If you’re looking for feedback on your project, or want people to use and share your work, this part is for you.

Remember, reaching your audience takes time. It may take months or years for you to grow a community around your project. Don’t give up! It’s all part of the process.
