## Why some people seek financial support

Much of open source work is unpaid or volunteered. For example, someone might come across a bug in a project they use and submit a quick fix, or they might enjoy tinkering with an open source project in their spare time. (Did you know that @gvanrossum started [Python](https://github.com/python) over a Christmas holiday?)

There are plenty of reasons why a person would not want to be paid for open source work:

* They may already have a full-time job that they love, which enables them to contribute to open source in their spare time.
* They enjoy thinking of open source as a hobby or creative escape and don't want to feel financially obligated to work on their projects.
* They get other benefits from contributing to open source, such as building their reputation or portfolio, learning a new skill, or feeling closer to a community.

> Financial donations do add a feeling of responsibility, for some. It's important for us, in the globally connected, fast-paced world we live in, to be able to say "not now, I feel like doing something completely different". - Eloy DurÃ¡n, ["Why We Don't Accept Donations"](http://blog.cocoapods.org/Why-we-dont-accept-donations/)

For others, especially when contributions are ongoing or require significant time, getting paid to contribute to open source is the only way they can afford to do so. Maintaining popular projects can be a significant responsibility, taking up 10 or 20 hours per week instead of a few hours per month.

> Ask any open source project maintainer, and they will tell you about the reality of the amount of work that goes into managing a project. You have clients. You are fixing issues for them. You are creating new features. This becomes a real demand on your time. - Ashe Dryden, ["The Ethics of Unpaid Labor and the OSS Community"](https://www.ashedryden.com/blog/the-ethics-of-unpaid-labor-and-the-oss-community)

Paid work also enables people from different walks of life to make meaningful contributions. Some people cannot afford to spend unpaid time on open source projects, based on their current financial position, debt, or family or other caretaking obligations. That means the world never sees contributions from talented people who can't afford to volunteer their time.

> OSS yields massive benefits to the technology industry, which, in turn, means benefits to all industries. However, if the only people who can focus on it are the lucky and the obsessed, then there's a huge untapped potential. - Issac Schlueter, ["Money and Open Source"](https://medium.com/open-source-life/money-and-open-source-d44a1953749c#.ftnd5qez0)

## Finding financial support

There are two ways to think about getting paid for open source work: 1) funding your own time as an contributor, and 2) finding organizational funding for the project.

### Funding your own time

Today, many people get paid to work part- or full-time to work on open source. The most common way to get paid for your time is to talk to your employer.

@hzoo, a maintainer of [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel), was able to make open source work part of his job at Adobe:

> Like many in open source, I was struggling with the burden of maintaining a project. When I first started doing open source, I used to just stay late to work on it or right when I got home. I was able to discuss with my boss the issues I was facing and we came up with ideas on how we could incorporate open source tasks given our own use of Babel.

It's easier to make a case for open source work if your employer actually uses the project, but get creative with your pitch. Maybe your employer doesn't use the project, but they use Python, and maintaining a popular Python project help attract new Python developers. Maybe it makes your employer look more developer-friendly in general.

If you don't have an existing open source project you're hoping to work on, but would rather that your current work output is open sourced, make a case for your employer to open source some of their internal software.

Many companies are developing open source programs to build their brand and recruit quality talent. For example, @hueniverse outlined the financial reasons for [Wal-Mart's investment in open source](https://hueniverse.com/2014/08/15/open-source-aint-charity/), and @jamesgpearce found that Facebook's open source program [made a difference](https://opensource.com/business/14/10/head-of-open-source-facebook-oscon) in recruiting:

> It is closely aligned with our hacker culture, and how our organization was perceived. We asked our employees, "Were you aware of the open source software program at Facebook?". Two-thirds said "Yes". One-half said that the program positively contributed to their decision to work for us. These are not marginal numbers, and I hope, a trend that continues.

If your company goes down this route, it's important to keep the boundaries between community and corporate activity clear, as @jessfraz explains [from her experience working on Docker](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/blurred-lines/):

> Getting paid to work on open source is a rare and wonderful opportunity, but you should not have to give up your passion in the process. Your passion should be why companies want to pay you.

If you can't convince your current employer to prioritize open source work, consider finding a new employer that encourages employee contributions to open source. Look for companies that make their dedication to open source work explicit. For example:

* [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) is a company built around [an open source project](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry)
* [Rackspace](https://www.rackspace.com/en-us) published its [open source contribution policy](https://blog.rackspace.com/rackspaces-policy-on-contributing-to-open-source/) for employees

Projects that originated at a large company, such as [Go](https://github.com/golang) or [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), will also likely employ people to work on open source.

Finally, depending on your personal circumstances, you can try raising money independently to fund your open source work. For example:

* @gaearon funded his work on [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) through a [Patreon crowdfunding campaign](http://redux.js.org/)
* @andrewgodwin funded work on Django schema migrations [through a Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/andrewgodwin/schema-migrations-for-django)

### Finding funding for your project

Beyond arrangements for individual contributors, sometimes projects raise money from companies, individuals, or others to fund ongoing work. For example:

* [webpack](https://github.com/webpack) raises money from companies and individuals [through OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/webpack)
* @yyx990803 funds his project, [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue), [through Patreon](https://github.com/open-source/stories/yyx990803)
* @indirect created [Ruby Together](https://rubytogether.org/), an organization that pays for work on [bundler](https://github.com/bundler/bundler), [RubyGems](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems), and other Ruby infrastructure projects

As open source's popularity increases, finding funding for projects is still experimental. A few current options include:

* **Raise money for your work through crowdfunding campaigns or donations.** This strategy works well if you have a strong audience or reputation already, or your project is very popular.
* **Apply for grant funding.** Some software foundations and companies offer grants for open source work, such as the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/grants/), [Mozilla Foundation](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/grants/), and [Stripe](https://stripe.com/blog/open-source-retreat-2016).
* **Raise sponsorships from companies and individual donors** through a software foundation. Or **start a business** to support the project.

For more detailed options and case studies, @nayafia [wrote a guide](https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand) to getting paid for open source work. Different types of funding require different skills, so consider your strengths to figure out which option works best for you.

## Building a case for financial support

Whether your project is a new idea, or has been around for years, you should expect to put significant thought into identifying your target funder and making a compelling case. That means thinking about:

* **Impact:** Why is this project useful? Where will it be in five years?
* **Traction:** Try to collect evidence that your project matters, whether it's metrics, anecdotes, or testimonials. Are there any companies or noteworthy people using your project right now? If not, has a prominent person endorsed it?
* **Value to funder:** Funders, whether your employer or a grantmaking foundation, are frequently approached with opportunities. Why should they support your project over any other opportunity? How do they personally benefit?
* **Use of funds:** What, exactly, will you accomplish with the proposed funding? Focus on project milestones or outcomes rather than paying a salary.
* **How you'll receive the funds:** Does the funder have any requirements around disbursal? For example, you may need to be a nonprofit or have a nonprofit fiscal sponsor. Or perhaps the funds must be given to an individual contractor rather than an organization. These requirements vary between funders, so be sure to do your research beforehand.

For his Kickstarter campaign, @davegandy [made a video](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/232193852/font-awesome-5) to explain why he raised funds for his project, [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome). The video not only included concrete examples of traction, but explained why he was raising money and what it would be used for:

> For years, we've been the leading resource of website friendly icons, with a community of over 20 million people and been featured on over 70 million websites, including Whitehouse.gov. Version 4 was three years ago. Web tech's changed a lot since then, and frankly, Font Awesome's gotten a bit stale. That's why we're introducing Font Awesome 5, a completely redesigned version...we're modernizing and rewriting the CSS and redesigning every icon from top to bottom. We're talking better design, better consistency, and better readability.

## Experiment and don't give up

Raising money isn't easy, whether you're an open source project or a software startup, and in most cases require you to get creative. Identifying how you want to get paid, doing your research, and putting yourself in your funder's shoes to create a personalized pitch will help you build a convincing case for funding.
