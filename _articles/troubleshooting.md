This section of the handbook addresses some common situations that may come up as you maintain your open source project.

These topics aren't fun. They may feel unfamiliar or force you out of your comfort zone. No matter what you decide, people may get upset or criticize how you handled the situation.

Sometimes, being a maintainer is a thankless job. If you're reading this section, however, you've taken a difficult but important first step towards leadership, and for that, we thank you. ❤️
