As you grow into a maintainer leadership role, you'll inevitably come across some tough situations.

These topics aren't fun. They may feel unfamiliar or force you out of your comfort zone. No matter what you decide, people may get upset or criticize how you handled the situation.

Sometimes, being a maintainer is a thankless job. You've taken a difficult but important step towards leadership. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for sharing your work and making a positive contribution to the world. ðŸ’•
