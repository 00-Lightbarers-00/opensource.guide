You've just published your projectâ€“what's next? It's time to tell everybody about your hard work!

We'll go through some of the most effective ways that people promote their open source projects. But before we do, let's start with a few tips that will help you make the most of your outreach.

## Be able to convey what your project does (and why it matters)

Before you start the hard work of promoting your project, you should be able to explain why your project is different or interesting. What would make someone excited about your work? Answering this question for yourself will make it easier to convince others.

The best way to invite people to share and contribute to your project is to share and contribute to their projects. Helping newcomers, sharing resources, and making thoughtful contributions to others' work will help you build a positive reputation. Then, when you launch your own project, people will have context for your work and be more likely to pay attention and share what you're doing.

There is no magical formula to building an audience and reputation. Gaining the trust and respect of others takes timeâ€”it's never too early or too late to start.

## Help people find and follow your project

You can help people find and remember your project by pointing them to your project's namespaceâ€”a website, Twitter handle, or IRC channel, for example.

Consider creating a website for your project. If your project is hosted on GitHub, you can use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to easily make a website.

@adrianholovaty [called a well-designed site](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7531689) "by far the best thing we did with Django in the early days". [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/), [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), and [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) are a few more examples of excellent, comprehensive websites.

A website, along with clear documentation and tutorials, makes your project friendlier and easier to navigate. It also suggests that your project is active, which will make your audience feel more comfortable using it. Add tutorials and examples to give people ideas for how to use your project.

A Twitter handle or IRC channel is like a calling card for your project. It gives your project's community a place to convene. If you don't wish to set up these channels for your project yet, promote your own Twitter or GitHub handle in everything you do. For example, make sure it is included in your bio or slides if you speak at a meetup or event. That way, people know how to reach you or follow your work.

Now that you have a marketing message for your project, and clear ways for people to reach you, let's get out there and talk to your audience!

## Go where your project's audience is (online)

Take advantage of existing online communities and platforms to reach your audience. Online outreach is a great way to share and spread the word quickly, and you have the potential to reach a very wide audience.

If your open source project is a software project, you can probably find your audience on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), [reddit](http://www.reddit.com), or [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). Find the channels where you think people will most benefit from or be excited about your work.

Consider introducing yourself and your work to related open source projects and communities. They may help promote your work to their audience through newsletters or forums, or you might find an opportunity to write a blog post or speak at an event. As your project grows, there may even be opportunities for collaboration.

## Go where your project's audience is (offline)

Look for meetups and conferences that are relevant to your work. Offline outreach is a great way to reach an engaged audience and build deeper human connections, especially if you are interested in reaching developers. @mitchellh [attributes](https://github.com/swinton/codeconf/blob/master/the-hashicorp-formula-to-open-source.md) [Vagrant](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant)'s growth and popularity to the talks he gave about the project.

If you're [new to public speaking](http://speaking.io/), start by finding a local meetup that's related to the language or ecosystem of your project. If you've never spoken at an event before, it's perfectly normal to feel nervous! Remember that your audience is there because they genuinely want to hear about your work. As you design your talk, remember to focus on what your audience will find interesting and get value out of. Keep your language friendly and approachable. Smile, breathe, and have fun.

When you feel ready, consider speaking at a conference to promote your project. Conferences can help you reach more people, sometimes from all over the world. Look for conferences that are specific to your language or ecosystem. Before you submit your talk, research the conference beforehand to tailor your talk to its attendees and increase your chances of getting accepted. You can often get a sense of a conference's audience by looking at its speakers.

Spreading the word is an important step in growing the popularity of your project. It can be scary to share your creativity with the world, so give yourself a high five for making it this far! ðŸ‘Œ ðŸ’¯ ðŸ™Œ

In the next section, we'll talk about how to retain those early enthusiasts and grow an engaged community around your project.
