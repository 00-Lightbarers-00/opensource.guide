Congratulations! You launched a project into the universe, and it managed to hit escape velocity. People are using your project, contributing back, and telling their friends. Your project has a bright future ahead of it. 👏 🚀 🌠

Maybe you're excited. Maybe you're terrified. Maybe your inbox is overflowing with unanswered questions and unreviewed pull requests. Fear not, brave maintainer. Now it's time to think about how to help your project grow while still maintaining your sanity.
