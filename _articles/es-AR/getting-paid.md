## ¿Porqué algunas personas buscan apoyo financiero?

La mayor parte del trabajo realizado en proyectos de código abierto es voluntario. Por ejemplo, alguien puede encontrarse con un error en un proyecto que usan y aplican una corrección rápida, o simplemente les puede gustar corregir proyectos de código abierto en su tiempo libre.

Estaba buscando un proyecto de programacion para tenerlo como "hobby" y que me mantuviese ocupado en la semana de navidad. (...) Tenía una computadora de hogar y no mucho más. Decidí escribir un interpretador para un nuevo lenguaje en el que he estado pensando últimamente. (...) Elegí Python como título de mi trabajo.

There are many reasons why a person would not want to be paid for their open source work.
Hay muchas razones por las cuales a una persona no le gustaría que le pagaran por su trabajo en código abierto.  
* **Ellos pueden llegar a tener ya un trabajo de tiempo completo que amen, **que los habilita a contribuir al código abierto en su tiempo libre.
* **Les gusta contribuir a los proyectos de código abierto como un hobby** o escape creativo y no quieren sentise financieramente obligados a trabajar. 
* **Reciben otros beneficios al contribuir al código abierto,** como construir su portfolio de reputación, aprender nuevas habilidades, o sentirse cercanos a una comunidad.

  Las donaciones financieras agregan un sentimiento de responsabilidad, para algunos. (...) Es importante para nosotros, en un mundo globalmente conectado y apresurado en el que vivimos, ser capaces de decir: "Espera, no ahora, quiero hacer algo completamente diferente".

Para otros, especialemente cuando las contribuciones están en proceso o requieren tiempo significativo, recibir dinero al contribuir al código abierto es la única manera en la que pueden participar. Porque el proyecto lo requiere o por razones personales. 

Mantener proyectos populares puede ser una responsabilidad significativa, tomando de 10 a 20 horas por semana en vez de un par de horas por mes.

  Ask any open source project maintainer, and they will tell you about the reality of the amount of work that goes into managing a project. You have clients. You are fixing issues for them. You are creating new features. This becomes a real demand on your time.

El trabajo pago también habilita a todo tipo de personas a aportar significativamente. Algunas no pueden afrontar un trabajo ad-honoren en proyectos de código abierto, por su posición financiera, deudas, familia u otras responsabilidades. Eso significa que el mundo nunca ve contribuciones de personas talentosas que no pueden donar horas de trabajo. Estas implicaciones éticas como @ashedryden [ha descripto](https://www.ashedryden.com/blog/the-ethics-of-unpaid-labor-and-the-oss-community), desde que el trabajo hecho es parcialmente en favor de las personas que tienen ventajas en su vida, quienes de vuelta ganan ventajas adicionales basadas en sus contribuciones voluntarias, mientras que otros que no pueden ofrecerse voluntariamente no obtiene nuevas oportunidades, lo cual refuerza la actual falta de diversidad en la comunidad de código abierto.

   OSS obtiene beneficios masívos de la industria de la tecnología, que, al mismo tiempo, significa beneficios para todas las industrias. (...) Por otro lado, si las únicas personas que pueden concentrarse en ello son los suertudos y obsesionados, entonces hay un gran potencial no explotado.

If you're looking for financial support, there are two paths to consider. You can fund your own time as a contributor, or you can find organizational funding for the project.

## Funding your own time

Today, many people get paid to work part- or full-time on open source. The most common way to get paid for your time is to talk to your employer.

It's easier to make a case for open source work if your employer actually uses the project, but get creative with your pitch. Maybe your employer doesn't use the project, but they use Python, and maintaining a popular Python project help attract new Python developers. Maybe it makes your employer look more developer-friendly in general.

  Like many in open source, I was struggling with the burden of maintaining a project. When I first started doing open source, I used to just stay late to work on it or right when I got home. (...) I was able to discuss with my boss the issues I was facing and we came up with ideas on how we could incorporate open source tasks given our own use of Babel.

If you don't have an existing open source project you'd like to work on, but would rather that your current work output is open sourced, make a case for your employer to open source some of their internal software.

Many companies are developing open source programs to build their brand and recruit quality talent.

@hueniverse, for example, found that there were financial reasons to justify [Walmart's investment in open source](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2608897/open-source-software/walmart-s-investment-in-open-source-isn-t-cheap.html). And @jamesgpearce found that Facebook's open source program [made a difference](https://opensource.com/business/14/10/head-of-open-source-facebook-oscon) in recruiting:

> It is closely aligned with our hacker culture, and how our organization was perceived. We asked our employees, "Were you aware of the open source software program at Facebook?". Two-thirds said "Yes". One-half said that the program positively contributed to their decision to work for us. These are not marginal numbers, and I hope, a trend that continues.

If your company goes down this route, it's important to keep the boundaries between community and corporate activity clear. Ultimately, open source sustains itself through contributions from people all over the world, and that's bigger than any one company or location.

  Getting paid to work on open source is a rare and wonderful opportunity, but you should not have to give up your passion in the process. Your passion should be why companies want to pay you.

If you can't convince your current employer to prioritize open source work, consider finding a new employer that encourages employee contributions to open source. Look for companies that make their dedication to open source work explicit. For example:

* Some companies, like [Netflix](https://netflix.github.io/) or [PayPal](http://paypal.github.io/), have websites that highlight their involvement in open source
* [Rackspace](https://www.rackspace.com/en-us) published its [open source contribution policy](https://blog.rackspace.com/rackspaces-policy-on-contributing-to-open-source/) for employees

Projects that originated at a large company, such as [Go](https://github.com/golang) or [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), will also likely employ people to work on open source.

Finally, depending on your personal circumstances, you can try raising money independently to fund your open source work. For example:

* @gaearon funded his work on [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) through a [Patreon crowdfunding campaign](http://redux.js.org/)
* @andrewgodwin funded work on Django schema migrations [through a Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/andrewgodwin/schema-migrations-for-django)

## Finding funding for your project

Beyond arrangements for individual contributors, sometimes projects raise money from companies, individuals, or others to fund ongoing work.

Organizational funding might go towards paying current contributors, covering the costs of running the project (such as hosting fees), or investing into new features or ideas.

As open source's popularity increases, finding funding for projects is still experimental, but there are a few common options available.

### Raise money for your work through crowdfunding campaigns or sponsorships

Finding sponsorships works well if you have a strong audience or reputation already, or your project is very popular.
A few examples of sponsored projects include:

* **[webpack](https://github.com/webpack)** raises money from companies and individuals [through OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/webpack)
* **[Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue)** is [funded through Patreon](https://github.com/open-source/stories/yyx990803)
* **[Ruby Together](https://rubytogether.org/),** a nonprofit organization that pays for work on [bundler](https://github.com/bundler/bundler), [RubyGems](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems), and other Ruby infrastructure projects

### Create a revenue stream

Depending on your project, you may be able to charge for commercial support, hosted options, or additional features. A few examples include:

* **[Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq)** offers paid versions for additional support
* **[Travis CI](https://github.com/travis-ci)** offers paid versions of its product
* **[Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost)** is a nonprofit with a paid managed service

Some popular projects, like [npm](https://github.com/npm/npm) and [Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker), even raise venture capital to support their business growth.

### Apply for grant funding

Some software foundations and companies offer grants for open source work. Sometimes, grants can be paid out to individuals without setting up a legal entity for the project.

* **[Read the Docs](https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org)** received a grant from [Mozilla Open Source Support](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/grants/)
* **[OpenMRS](https://github.com/openmrs)** work was funded by [Stripe's Open-Source Retreat](https://stripe.com/blog/open-source-retreat-2016-grantees)
* **[Libraries.io](https://github.com/librariesio)** received a grant from the [Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org/programs/digital-technology)
* The **[Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/grants/)** offers grants for Python-related work

For more detailed options and case studies, @nayafia [wrote a guide](https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand) to getting paid for open source work. Different types of funding require different skills, so consider your strengths to figure out which option works best for you.

## Building a case for financial support

Whether your project is a new idea, or has been around for years, you should expect to put significant thought into identifying your target funder and making a compelling case.

Whether you're looking to pay for your own time, or fundraise for a project, you should be able to answer the following questions.

### Impact

Why is this project useful? Why do your users, or potential users, like it so much? Where will it be in five years?

### Traction

Try to collect evidence that your project matters, whether it's metrics, anecdotes, or testimonials. Are there any companies or noteworthy people using your project right now? If not, has a prominent person endorsed it?

### Value to funder

Funders, whether your employer or a grantmaking foundation, are frequently approached with opportunities. Why should they support your project over any other opportunity? How do they personally benefit?

### Use of funds

What, exactly, will you accomplish with the proposed funding? Focus on project milestones or outcomes rather than paying a salary.

### How you'll receive the funds

Does the funder have any requirements around disbursal? For example, you may need to be a nonprofit or have a nonprofit fiscal sponsor. Or perhaps the funds must be given to an individual contractor rather than an organization. These requirements vary between funders, so be sure to do your research beforehand.

## Experiment and don't give up

Raising money isn't easy, whether you're an open source project, a nonprofit, or a software startup, and in most cases require you to get creative. Identifying how you want to get paid, doing your research, and putting yourself in your funder's shoes will help you build a convincing case for funding.
