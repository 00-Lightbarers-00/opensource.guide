## 성공을 위한 프로젝트 설정하기

프로젝트를 시작하고, 단어를 전파하면, 사람들이 그것을 확인하고 있습니다. 굉장합니다! 자, 어떻게 그들을 주변에 붙이게 할까요?

환영하는 커뮤니티는 프로젝트의 미래와 평판에 대한 투자입니다. 프로젝트가 처음으로 기여한 것을 보기 시작한 경우, 초반 참여자에게 긍정적인 경험을 제공하고, 그들이 계속해서 다시 돌아올 수 있도록 하십시오.

### 사람들이 환영받는다고 느끼게하기

프로젝트 커뮤니티에 대해 생각하는 한 가지 방법은 @MikeMcQuaid는 [contributor funnel](https://speakerdeck.com/mikemcquaid/the-open-source-contributor-funnel)라고 했습니다:

![Contributor funnel](/assets/images/building-community/contributor_funnel_mikemcquaid.png)

커뮤니티를 구축하면서 깔때기의 맨 위에 있는 누군가(잠재 사용자)가 이론적으로 맨 아래(활동중인 관리자)로 나아갈 수있는 방법을 생각해보십시오. 목표는 기여자 환경의 각 단계에서 마찰을 줄이는 것입니다. 사람들이 쉽게 이를 이겨낸다면, 더 많은 일을 하도록 동기 부여를 느낄 것입니다.

문서화로 시작하기:

* **프로젝트를 쉽게 사용할 수 있도록하십시오.** [친숙한 README](../starting-a-project/#writing-a-readme)와 명확한 코드 예제를 사용하면 프로젝트에 착수한 모든 사람이 쉽게 시작할 수 있습니다.
* **기여 방법을 분명히 설명하십시오.**, [CONTRIBUTING 파일](../starting-a-project/#writing-your-contributing-guidelines)를 사용하고 이슈를 최신 상태로 유지하시기바랍니다.

[깃허브의 2017 오픈소스 설문](http://opensourcesurvey.org/2017/)에 따르면 불완전하거나 혼란스러운 문서가 오픈소스 사용자에게 가장 큰 문제임이 드러났습니다. 좋은 문서는 사람들이 프로젝트와 상호 작용하도록 유도합니다. 결국 누군가가 이슈를 열거나 pull request를 합니다. 이러한 상호 작용을 통해 유입 경로로 이동할 수 있습니다.

* **누군가 새로운 프로젝트를 시작했을 때 관심을 가져주셔서 감사합니다!** 누군가가 돌아오고 싶지 않게 만드는 것은 오직 하나의 부정적인 경험을 필요로 합니다.
* **반응합니다.** 한 달 동안 문제에 답변하지 않으면, 프로젝트에 대해 이미 잊어 버렸을 가능성이 있습니다.
* **받아 들일 수있는 기여 유형에 대해 개방적이어야합니다.** 많은 기여자는 버그 신고 또는 작은 수정으로 시작합니다.프로젝트에 [기여 할 수 있는 많은 방법](../how-to-contribute/#what-it-means-to-contribute)이 있습니다. 사람들이 어떻게 도와주고 싶어하는지 돕도록하십시오.
* **당신이 동의하지 않는 기여가 있다면,** 그들에게 아이디어에 대해 감사하고, 프로젝트의 범위에 맞지 않는 [이유를 설명](../best-practices/#learning-to-say-no)하고, 관련 문서에 링크하면됩니다.

  Contributing to open source is easier for some than others. There's a lot of fear of being yelled at for not doing something right or just not fitting in. (...) By giving contributors a place to contribute with very low technical proficiency (documentation, web content markdown, etc) you can greatly reduce those concerns.

오픈 소스 제공자의 대다수는 "임시 기여자"입니다. 때때로 프로젝트에만 기여하는 사람들입니다. 캐주얼 기여자는 프로젝트 진행 속도를 최대로 끌어 올릴 시간이 없을 수도 있기 때문에, 당신의 일은 그들이 기여하기 쉽게 만드는 것입니다.

다른 참여자를 격려하는 것은 자신에게도 투자입니다. 가장 열렬한 팬에게 흥분을 줄 수있는 힘을 실어 줄 때, 모든 것을 스스로 할 수있는 부담이 줄어 듭니다.

### 모든 곳에 문서화하기

</aside>

새로운 프로젝트를 시작하면, 작업을 비공개로 유지하는 것이 자연스럽게 느껴질 수 있습니다. 그러나 오픈소스 프로젝트는 공개적으로 프로세스를 문서화 할 때 번창합니다.

당신이 일을 적을 때, 더 많은 사람들이 모든 단계에서 참여할 수 있습니다. 자신이 필요로 하지 않는 것에 대해서 도움을 받을 수도 있습니다.

사물을 쓰는 것은 기술 문서 이상의 것을 의미합니다. 뭔가를 쓰거나 프로젝트에 대해 개인적으로 토론할 충동을 느낄 때마다, 공개 할 수 있는지 스스로에게 자문 해보십시오.

프로젝트의 로드맵, 찾고있는 기여 유형, 기여 검토 방법 또는 특정 결정을 한 이유에 대해 투명하게 하십시오.

여러 사용자가 동일한 문제를 겪고있는 경우, README에 답변을 문서화하십시오.

회의의 경우, 관련 문제에 메모나 테이크아웃을 게시하는 것을 고려하십시오. 이 투명성 수준에서 얻을 수있는 피드백은 당신을 놀라게 할 수 있습니다.

모든 것을 문서화하는 것은 당신이 하는 일에도 적용됩니다. 프로젝트에 대한 실질적인 업데이트를 진행중인 경우, pull request에 넣고 진행중인 작업 (WIP)으로 표시합니다. 그렇게하면 다른 사람들이 조기에 프로세스에 참여할 수 있습니다.

### 반응하기

As you [promote your project](../finding-users), people will have feedback for you. They may have questions about how things work, or need help getting started.

Try to be responsive when someone files an issue, submits a pull request, or asks a question about your project. When you respond quickly, people will feel they are part of a dialogue, and they'll be more enthusiastic about participating.

Even if you can't review the request immediately, acknowledging it early helps increase engagement. Here's how @tdreyno responded to a pull request on [Middleman](https://github.com/middleman/middleman/pull/1466):

![Middleman pull request](/assets/images/building-community/middleman_pr.png)

[A Mozilla study found that](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hsJLv1ieSqtXBzd5YZusY-mB8e1VJzaeOmh8Q4VeMio/edit#slide=id.g43d857af8_0177) contributors who received code reviews within 48 hours had a much higher rate of return and repeat contribution.

Conversations about your project could also be happening in other places around the internet, such as Stack Overflow, Twitter, or Reddit. You can set up notifications in some of these places so you are alerted when someone mentions your project.

### 커뮤니티에 모일 곳을 제공하기

커뮤니티에 모일 수 있는 이유는 두 가지입니다.

첫번째 이유는 그들을 위한 것입니다. 사람들이 서로를 알게 도와주세요. 공통 관심사를 가진 사람들은 필연적으로 그것에 대해 이야기 할 곳을 원할 것입니다. 커뮤니케이션이 공개되고 접근이 용이할 때, 누구나 과거 아카이브를 읽어 신속하게 참여하고 참여할 수 있습니다.

두 번째 이유는 당신을 위한 것입니다. 사람들에게 프로젝트에 관해 이야기 할 수 있는 공공장소를 제공하지 않으면 직접 연락을 취할 것입니다. 처음에는 개인 메시지에 "단지 한 번" 응답하는 것만큼 쉬운 것처럼 보일 수 있습니다. 그러나 시간이 지남에 따라 프로젝트가 대중화되면 특히 고갈 될 것입니다. 개인적으로 프로젝트에 대한 사람들과 소통하려는 유혹에 현혹되지 마십시오. 대신 지정된 공개 채널로 안내하십시오.

공개 커뮤니케이션은 사람들에게 직접 이메일을 보내거나 블로그에 댓글을다는 대신 문제를 열도록 지시하는 것처럼 간단 할 수 있습니다. 또한 메일 링리스트를 설정하거나 Twitter 계정, 슬랙 또는 IRC 채널을 만들어 사람들이 프로젝트에 관해 이야기 할 수 있습니다. 또는 위의 모든 것을 시도하십시오!

[Kubernetes kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops#getting-involved) sets aside office hours every other week to help community members:

> Kops also has time set aside every other week to offer help and guidance to the community. Kops maintainers have agreed to set aside time specifically dedicated to working with newcomers, helping with PRs, and discussing new features.

Notable exceptions to public communication are: 1) security issues and 2) sensitive code of conduct violations. You should always have a way for people to report these issues privately. If you don't want to use your personal email, set up a dedicated email address.

## 커뮤니티 성장하기

Communities are extremely powerful. That power can be a blessing or a curse, depending on how you wield it. As your project's community grows, there are ways to help it become a force of construction, not destruction.

### 나쁜 배우를 용서하지 말기

Any popular project will inevitably attract people who harm, rather than help, your community. They may start unnecessary debates, quibble over trivial features, or bully others.

Do your best to adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards these types of people. If left unchecked, negative people will make other people in your community uncomfortable. They may even leave.

  The truth is that having a supportive community is key. I'd never be able to do this work without the help of my colleagues, friendly internet strangers, and chatty IRC channels. (...) Don't settle for less. Don't settle for assholes.

  </p>
</aside>

Regular debates over trivial aspects of your project distracts others, including you, from focusing on important tasks. New people who arrive to your project may see these conversations and not want to participate.

When you see negative behavior happening on your project, call it out publicly. Explain, in a kind but firm tone, why their behavior is not acceptable. If the problem persists, you may need to [ask them to leave](../code-of-conduct/#enforcing-your-code-of-conduct). Your [code of conduct](../code-of-conduct/) can be a constructive guide for these conversations.

### 장소에 있는 기여자를 만나기

Good documentation only becomes more important as your community grows. Casual contributors, who may not otherwise be familiar with your project, read your documentation to quickly get the context they need.

In your CONTRIBUTING file, explicitly tell new contributors how to get started. You may even want to make a dedicated section for this purpose. [Django](https://github.com/django/django), for example, has a special landing page to welcome new contributors.

![Django new contributors page](/assets/images/building-community/django_new_contributors.png)

In your issue queue, label bugs that are suitable for different types of contributors: for example, [_"first timers only"_](https://medium.com/@kentcdodds/first-timers-only-78281ea47455#.g1k01jy05), _"good first bug"_, or _"documentation"_. [These labels](https://github.com/librariesio/libraries.io/blob/6afea1a3354aef4672d9b3a9fc4cc308d60020c8/app/models/github_issue.rb#L8-L14) make it easy for someone new to your project to quickly scan your issues and get started.

Finally, use your documentation to make people feel welcome at every step of the way.

You will never interact with most people who land on your project. There may be contributions you didn't receive because somebody felt intimidated or didn't know where to get started. Even a few kind words can keep someone from leaving your project in frustration.

For example, here's how [Rubinius](https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius/) starts [its contributing guide](https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius/blob/master/.github/contributing.md):

> We want to start off by saying thank you for using Rubinius. This project is a labor of love, and we appreciate all of the users that catch bugs, make performance improvements, and help with documentation. Every contribution is meaningful, so thank you for participating. That being said, here are a few guidelines that we ask you to follow so we can successfully address your issue.

People are excited to contribute to projects when they feel a sense of ownership. That doesn't mean you need to turn over your project's vision or accept contributions you don't want. But the more you give credit to others, the more they'll stick around.

See if you can find ways to share ownership with your community as much as possible. Here are some ideas:

* **Resist fixing easy (non-critical) bugs.** Instead, use them as opportunities to recruit new contributors, or mentor someone who'd like to contribute. It may seem unnatural at first, but your investment will pay off over time. For example, @michaeljoseph asked a contributor to submit a pull request on a [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) issue below, rather than fix it himself.

![Cookiecutter issue](/assets/images/building-community/cookiecutter_submit_pr.png)

* **Start a CONTRIBUTORS or AUTHORS file in your project** that lists everyone who's contributed to your project, like [Sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/blob/master/AUTHORS.md) does.

* If you've got a sizable community, **send out a newsletter or write a blog post** thanking contributors. Rust's [This Week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/) and Hoodie's [Shoutouts](http://hood.ie/blog/shoutouts-week-24.html) are two good examples.

* **Give every contributor commit access.** @felixge found that this made people [more excited to polish their patches](http://felixge.de/2013/03/11/the-pull-request-hack.html), and he even found new maintainers for projects that he hadn't worked on in awhile.

* If your project is on GitHub, **move your project from your personal account to an [Organization](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-organization-account/)** and add at least one backup admin. Organizations make it easier to work on projects with external collaborators.

The reality is that [most projects only have](https://peerj.com/preprints/1233.pdf) one or two maintainers who do most of the work. The bigger your project, and the bigger your community, the easier it is to find help.

While you may not always find someone to answer the call, putting a signal out there increases the chances that other people will pitch in. And the earlier you start, the sooner people can help.

## 충돌 해결하기

In the early stages of your project, making major decisions is easy. When you want to do something, you just do it.

As your project becomes more popular, more people will take interest in the decisions you make. Even if you don't have a big community of contributors, if your project has a lot of users, you'll find people weighing in on decisions or raising issues of their own.

For the most part, if you've cultivated a friendly, respectful community and documented your processes openly, your community should be able to find resolution. But sometimes you run into an issue that's a bit harder to address.

### 친절에 대한 바 설정

When your community is grappling with a difficult issue, tempers may rise. People may become angry or frustrated and take it out on one another, or on you.

Your job as a maintainer is to keep these situations from escalating. Even if you have a strong opinion on the topic, try to take the position of a moderator or facilitator, rather than jumping into the fight and pushing your views. If someone is being unkind or monopolizing the conversation, [act immediately](../building-community/#dont-tolerate-bad-actors) to keep discussions civil and productive.

  As a project maintainer, it's extremely important to be respectful to your contributors. They often take what you say very personally.

  </p>
</aside>

Other people are looking to you for guidance. Set a good example. You can still express disappointment, unhappiness, or concern, but do so calmly.

Keeping your cool isn't easy, but demonstrating leadership improves the health of your community. The internet thanks you.

### README를 헌법으로 다루기

Your README is [more than just a set of instructions](../starting-a-project/#writing-a-readme). It's also a place to talk about your goals, product vision, and roadmap. If people are overly focused on debating the merit of a particular feature, it may help to revisit your README and talk about the higher vision of your project. Focusing on your README also depersonalizes the conversation, so you can have a constructive discussion.

### 목적지가 아닌, 여행에 집중하기

Some projects use a voting process to make major decisions. While sensible at first glance, voting emphasizes getting to an "answer," rather than listening to and addressing each other's concerns.

Voting can become political, where community members feel pressured to do each other favors or vote a certain way. Not everybody votes, either, whether it's the [silent majority](http://ben.balter.com/2016/03/08/optimizing-for-power-users-and-edge-cases/#the-silent-majority-of-users) in your community, or current users who didn't know a vote was taking place.

Sometimes, voting is a necessary tiebreaker. As much as you are able, however, emphasize ["consensus seeking"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making) rather than consensus.

Under a consensus seeking process, community members discuss major concerns until they feel they have been adequately heard. When only minor concerns remain, the community moves forward. "Consensus seeking" acknowledges that a community may not be able to reach a perfect answer. Instead, it prioritizes listening and discussion.

<aside markdown="1" class="pquote">
  <img src="https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1038121?v=3&s=460" class="pquote-avatar" alt="avatar">
  Part of the reason why a voting system doesn't exist for Atom Issues is because the Atom team isn't going to follow a voting system in all cases. Sometimes we have to choose what we feel is right even if it is unpopular. (...) What I can offer and pledge to do...is that it is my job to listen to the community.

  </p>
</aside>

Even if you don't actually adopt a consensus seeking process, as a project maintainer, it's important that people know you are listening. Making other people feel heard, and committing to resolving their concerns, goes a long way to diffuse sensitive situations. Then, follow up on your words with actions.

Don't rush into a decision for the sake of having a resolution. Make sure that everybody feels heard and that all information has been made public before moving toward a resolution.

### 대화는 행동에 초점을 맞추기

Discussion is important, but there is a difference between productive and unproductive conversations.

Encourage discussion so long as it is actively moving towards resolution. If it's clear that conversation is languishing or going off-topic, jabs are getting personal, or people are quibbling about minor details, it's time to shut it down.

Allowing these conversations to continue is not only bad for the issue at hand, but bad for the health of your community. It sends a message that these types of conversations are permitted or even encouraged, and it can discourage people from raising or resolving future issues.

With every point made by you or by others, ask yourself, _"How does this bring us closer to a resolution?"_

If the conversation is starting to unravel, ask the group, _"Which steps should we take next?"_ to refocus the conversation.

If a conversation clearly isn't going anywhere, there are no clear actions to be taken, or the appropriate action has already been taken, close the issue and explain why you closed it.

  Guiding a thread toward usefulness without being pushy is an art. It won't work to simply admonish people to stop wasting their time, or to ask them not to post unless they have something constructive to say. (...) Instead, you have to suggest conditions for further progress: give people a route, a path to follow that leads to the results you want, yet without sounding like you're dictating conduct.

### 현명하게 전투를 선택하기

Context is important. Consider who is involved in the discussion and how they represent the rest of the community.

Is everybody in the community upset about, or even engaged with, this issue? Or is a lone troublemaker? Don't forget to consider your silent community members, not just the active voices.

If the issue does not represent the broader needs of your community, you may just need to acknowledge the concerns of a few people. If this is a recurring issue without a clear resolution, point them to previous discussions on the topic and close the thread.

### 커뮤니티 동점자 식별하기

With a good attitude and clear communication, most difficult situations are resolvable. However, even in a productive conversation, there can simply be a difference in opinion on how to proceed. In these cases, identify an individual or group of people that can serve as a tiebreaker.

A tiebreaker could be the primary maintainer of the project, or it could be a small group of people who make a decision based on voting. Ideally, you've identified a tiebreaker and the associated process in a GOVERNANCE file before you ever have to use it.

Your tiebreaker should be a last resort. Divisive issues are an opportunity for your community to grow and learn. Embrace these opportunities and use a collaborative process to move to a resolution wherever possible.

## 커뮤니티는 오픈소스의  ❤️ 입니다

Healthy, thriving communities fuel the thousands of hours poured into open source every week. Many contributors point to other people as the reason for working - or not working - on open source. By learning how to tap into that power constructively, you'll help someone out there have an unforgettable open source experience.
