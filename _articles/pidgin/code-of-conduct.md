## Code of conduct and why you need am?

Code of conduct na document wey dey establish expectation for the way wey people go take behave for your project. To adopt, and enforce, code of conduct fit help create positive social atmosphere for your community.

Code of conduct epp to protect not just the people wey dey participate for your project, but you too. If you dey maintain a project, you fit see say unproductive attitude from other people fit dey drain your energy and make you unhappy about your work as time dey go.

Code of conduct dey give you power to encourage healthy and constructive community behavior. To dey proactive dey reduce the chance say you, or other people, go dey tire for your project, and epp you take action if person do something wey you nor gree with.

## How you go take arrange code of conduct

Make you try your best to arrange code of conduct early, if you fit, ideally when you first create your project.

Apart from just communicating your expectations, code of conduct fit describe the following:

- Where the code of conduct dey apply _(only on issues and pull requests, or community activities like events?)_
- Whom the code of conduct dey apply to _(community members and maintainers, but what about sponsors?)_
- Wetin go happen if person violate the code of conduct
- How person fit report violations

Anywhere way you fit, try to use previous example. The [Contributor Covenant](https://contributor-covenant.org/) na code of conduct wey many open source projects, including Kubernetes, Rails, and Swift, don use, and e fit serve as example.

The [Django Code of Conduct](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/) and the [Citizen Code of Conduct](https://web.archive.org/web/20200330154000/http://citizencodeofconduct.org/) na two good examples of code of conduct.

Put one CODE_OF_CONDUCT file for your project's main directory, and make sure say your community fit see am by linking am for your CONTRIBUTING or README file.

## How to enforce your code of conduct

You suppose explain how you go enforce your code of conduct **_before_** person violate am. Some reasons why you suppose do am be say:

- E show say you dey serious about action when e dey necessary.

- Your community go dey reassured say complaints go dey reviewed.

- You go reassure your community say the review process go dey fair and transparent, if at any time dem dey investigated for violation.

You suppose give people private way (like email address) to report code of conduct violation and explain who go receive that report. E fit be maintainer, group of maintainers, or code of conduct working group.

No forget say person fit wan report violation about person wey dey receive those reports. In this case, give dem option to report violations to another person. For example, @ctb and @mr-c [explain for their project](https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/blob/HEAD/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.rst), [khmer](https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer):

> Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by emailing **khmer-project@idyll.org** which only goes to C. Titus Brown and Michael R. Crusoe. To report an issue involving either of them please email **Judi Brown Clarke, Ph.D.** the Diversity Director at the BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action, an NSF Center for Science and Technology.

For inspiration, check out Django's [enforcement manual](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/enforcement-manual/) (though you may not need something this comprehensive, depending on the size of your project).
