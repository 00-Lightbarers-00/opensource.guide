So you're interested in making your project open source? Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ The world appreciates your contribution.

Let's start by talking about what it means to open source your work.

## What is open source?

When a project is "open source", that means that anybody can view, use, modify, and distribute your project for any purpose.

For example, imagine you are a designer working on a website for a paid client. You're searching for the right font to use.

If you wanted to use [Arial](https://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FMID=1909), a popular closed source font created by Microsoft, you would need to purchase a license before using it in your project. There are various licenses available that specify what you can do with the font and whether it's for personal or commercial use. You cannot view Arial's font files, and you cannot contribute changes to the Arial font.

On the other hand, imagine you wanted to use [Arvo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Arvo?ref=marketopia), an open source font created by Google. You are free to download the font from Google and use it for any purpose, personal or commercial. You can [view the files](https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/master/ofl/arvo) that make up the Arvo font, and if you wanted to contribute back to the project, you could open an issue or pull request on Google's [font repository](https://github.com/google/fonts).

Open source is powerful because it lowers the barriers to adoption, allowing ideas to spread quickly, and because the production process is open to the public.

## Does open source mean free of charge?

One of open source's biggest draws is that it does not cost money, but that is just a byproduct of its value.

Open source is defined by its license. There are many open source licenses, but all of them grant permission for anyone to use, modify, and share licensed software for any purpose, subject to certain conditions.

When you "open source" a project, it means you've added these [legal protections and freedoms](https://opensource.org/osd) that allow others to interact with your project.

Because an open source project lets anyone view, use, and distribute the project, they tend to be free of cost. If the project cost money to use, anyone could legally make a copy and use the free version instead. That's why most open source projects are free, but "free of charge" is not part of the open source definition. There are ways to charge for open source projects indirectly through dual licensing or limited features, while still complying with the official definition of open source.

## Open source is more than just a license

That's the legal side of it. In terms of culture, open sourcing a project has come to mean much more. There are many reasons why a person or organization might want to open source a project. Some examples include:

* **Transparency:** Anyone can inspect an open source project for errors or inconsistencies. Transparency matters to governments like [Bulgaria](https://medium.com/@bozhobg/bulgaria-got-a-law-requiring-open-source-98bf626cf70a) or the [United States](https://sourcecode.cio.gov/), regulated industries like banking or healthcare, and security software like [Let's Encrypt](https://github.com/letsencrypt).

* **Collaboration:** Open source projects can accept changes and updates from anybody, which means they benefit from multiple skill sets and experiences. Collaboration matters to those who want to build their projects with a community, like [Hoodie](https://github.com/hoodiehq) and [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust).

* **Adoption and remixing:** Open source projects can be used by anyone for any purpose. They can be shared and reused (like [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)) to reach more people, or they can be used to build something else (like [WordPress and b2](https://github.com/WordPress/book/blob/master/Content/Part%201/2-b2-cafelog.md)).

Remember: open source isn't just for software! You can open source everything from data sets to websites to books. Check out [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore) for ideas on what else you can open source.

## Public projects on GitHub without a license are not open source

When you [create a new project](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/) on GitHub, you have the option to make the repository **private** or **public**.

Public repositories on GitHub are covered by [GitHub's Terms of Service](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#f-copyright-and-content-ownership), which gives other people the right to view and fork your repository. But if you want others to use, copy, modify, or contribute back to your project, you need to include an open source license.

A **public** repository is not **open source** unless you choose an open source license. For example, someone cannot legally use any part of your GitHub project in their code, even if it's public, unless you explicitly give them the right to do so. (You can learn more about the legal side of open source [here](../legal/).)

It's easy to add a license. You'll be [asked to add one](https://help.github.com/articles/open-source-licensing/) when you create a new repository.

When you open source a project, you open yourself to feedback and suggestions from other people who are engaged with your work. It might feel intimidating to open source a project for the first time, but remember that you're not alone.

In the next section, we'll help you figure out your goals around open sourcing your project. Understanding your goals beforehand will make it easier to manage your and others' expectations later on.
