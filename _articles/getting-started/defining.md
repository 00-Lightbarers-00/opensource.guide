So you're thinking about making your project open source? Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ The world appreciates your contribution. Let's talk about what "open source" is, how to make a project open source, and why people do it.

## What is open source?

When a project is "open source", that means that **anybody can view, use, modify, and distribute your project for any purpose.**

For example, imagine you want to make a website. You will need a programming language to write it.

Many commonly used programming languages, such as [Ruby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby), are open source. Because they're open source, you're free to download and use them as you wish. You can use Ruby to teach classes, or build a website that makes money. You can view the code that powers Ruby, so you know exactly what you're putting into your website. You can even contribute changes back to the Ruby language, or modify it for your own purposes.

By comparison, if you were to use a closed source language to build your website, you couldn't change or inspect the code. You might have to pay to use it, or be prevented from using it for commercial purposes.

Open source is powerful because it lowers the barriers to adoption, allowing ideas to spread quickly, and because the production process is open to the public.

## Does open source mean "free of charge"?

One of open source's biggest draws is that it does not cost money, but that is just a byproduct of its value.

Open source is defined by its license. There are many open source licenses, but all of them grant permission for anyone to use, modify, and share licensed software for any purpose, subject to certain conditions.

When you "open source" a project, it means you've added a license containing the above [legal protections and freedoms](https://opensource.org/osd), which allow others to interact with your project.

Because an open source project lets anyone view, use, and distribute the project, they tend to be free of cost. If the project cost money to use, anyone could legally make a copy and use the free version instead. That's why most open source projects are free, but "free of charge" is not part of the open source definition. There are ways to charge for open source projects indirectly through dual licensing or limited features, while still complying with the official definition of open source.

## Open source is more than just a license

That's the legal side of it. In terms of culture, open sourcing a project has come to mean much more. When you open source a project, you're inviting feedback and suggestions from other people who are engaged with your work.

There are many reasons why a person or organization might want to open source a project. Some examples include:

* **Transparency:** Anyone can inspect an open source project for errors or inconsistencies. Transparency matters to governments like [Bulgaria](https://medium.com/@bozhobg/bulgaria-got-a-law-requiring-open-source-98bf626cf70a) or the [United States](https://sourcecode.cio.gov/), regulated industries like banking or healthcare, and security software like [Let's Encrypt](https://github.com/letsencrypt).

* **Collaboration:** Open source projects can accept changes and updates from anybody, which means they benefit from multiple skill sets and experiences. Collaboration matters to those who want to build their projects with a community, like [Hoodie](https://github.com/hoodiehq) and [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust).

* **Adoption and remixing:** Open source projects can be used by anyone for any purpose. They can be shared and reused (like [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)) to reach more people, or they can be used to build something else (like [WordPress and b2](https://github.com/WordPress/book/blob/master/Content/Part%201/2-b2-cafelog.md)).

Remember: open source isn't just for software! You can open source everything from data sets to websites to books. Check out [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore) for ideas on what else you can open source.

## Public projects on GitHub without a license are not open source

When you [create a new project](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/) on GitHub, you have the option to make the repository **private** or **public**.

Public repositories on GitHub are covered by [GitHub's Terms of Service](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#f-copyright-and-content-ownership), which gives other people the right to view and fork your repository. But if you want others to use, copy, modify, or contribute back to your project, you need to include an open source license.

**A public repository is not open source** unless you choose an open source license. For example, someone cannot legally use any part of your GitHub project in their code, even if it's public, unless you explicitly give them the right to do so. (You can learn more about the legal side of open source [here](../legal/).)

It's easy to add a license. You'll be [asked to add one](https://help.github.com/articles/open-source-licensing/) when you create a new repository.
