There are many reasons to open source a project. It's a good idea to figure out yours before going public with your project. What you want to get out of the experience will guide how you manage your project and help you figure out where to say yes (and no!).

In this section, we'll help you think through a few important questions about the goals of your project.

## Your first time

If you've never open sourced a project before, you might be nervous about whether your work is good enough, what people will say, or whether anyone will notice at all. If this sounds like you, don't worry!

Open source work is like any other creative activity, such as writing or painting. It might feel scary to share your work with the world for the first time, but the only way to get better is to practice. If you're still on the fence, [check out these reasons](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bianca-bass/why-you-should-write-even_b_9331252.html) why people write, even when they don't have an audience.

## Define your goals

Let's start by defining your goals. Simply put: _why are you open sourcing this project?_

There is no one right answer to this question. You may find that you have multiple goals for a single project, or that different projects have different goals. The most important thing is to be honest with yourself.

Here are some examples of [reasons](http://ben.balter.com/2015/11/23/why-open-source/) why people open source their work:

* A person wants to show off their portfolio or get feedback
* A community wants to find collaborators to shape the project and help it grow
* A person (or company) wants others to use what they've created
* A company wants make their code transparent

If your goal is to learn how to collaborate with others or understand how open source works, you might also want to [contribute to an existing open source project](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/), rather than creating your own. There are many active community projects who would love to help you! [First Timers Only](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/) and [Your First PR](https://yourfirstpr.github.io/) are a few resources that can help you get started.

## Reflect on your goals

Once you've listed out your goals, ask yourself: _based on my goals, what do I (or we) expect from this project?_

You don't have to overthink it at this stage, but it's helpful to think about what you might expect from others, and what others might expect from you.

For example, if your only goal is to show off your work, you may not want contributions, and even state that you're not accepting contributions in your README (like [infinite-scroll](https://github.com/infinite-scroll/infinite-scroll) does).

On the other hand, if you are building a community project, you may be actively looking for contributors. In that case, you might want to invest work into clear, detailed documentation and making newcomers feel welcome (like [Sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) does).

If you're hoping people will contribute to your project, remember that as your project grows, your community may need more than just code from you. Responding to issues, reviewing code, and evangelizing your project are all important tasks in an open source project. While the amount of time you spend on non-coding tasks will depend on the size and scope of your project, you should be prepared as a maintainer to address them yourself or find someone to help you.

## Save your answers, you'll need them!

Writing down your goals will help you throughout the life of your project. A clear set of goals can help you figure out what to work on, what to say no to, and where you need help from others.

Consider listing your goals in the README of your project. Successful open source projects try to document as much as they can in public. Much like reusable pieces of code, reusable information means less people need to ask you the same questions over and over again. Making your goals public will remind you, and others, of what matters.
